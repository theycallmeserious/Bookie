ASP.NET MVC 8 Project Performing Basic CRUD Operations.

This is a demo project that I used for showing CRUD Operations ( Insert, Update, Delete, and Retrieve) with the Latest ASP.NET Core 8.0 MVC using Entity Framework Core and SQL Server DB.

Points discussed :

* Create MVC Project
* Define EF Core Model
* Dependency Injection
* DB Connection String
* Database Migration
* Create MVC Controller
* Layout Page
* Insert Operation
* Form Validation in MVC
* Form Submission
* Display Existing Records
* Update Operation
* Delete Operation
