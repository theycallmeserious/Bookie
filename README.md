# Employees

This is a demo project that I used for showing CRUD Operations ( Insert, Update, Delete, and Retrieve) with the Latest ASP.NET Core 8.0 using Entity Framework Core and SQL Server DB and Angular.

Points discussed :

* Create API, Angular Projects
* Define EF Core Model
* Dependency Injection
* DB Connection String
* Database Migration
* Create Controller
* Layout Page
* Insert Operation
* Form Validation in Angular
* Form Submission
* Display Existing Records
* Update Operation
* Delete Operation
